I am a Post-Doctoral Associate at the [Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/center-for-artificial-intelligence-and-robotics.html) at NYUAD lead by [Prof. Anthony Tzes](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/engineering/faculty/anthony-tzes.html), [Prof. Farshad Khorrami](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/farshad-khorrami) and [Prof. Yann LeCun](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/yann-lecun). I am currently interested in building brain controlled interfaces using EEG and Machine Learning.

I have obtained my PhD in Electrical Engineering from NYU Tandon School of Engineering in September 2022. My PhD research was in the intriguing intersection of haptics, neuroscience, signal processing and machine learning. The main focus of my PhD research was on developing a conceptual framework for modeling and understanding the haptic experience through neural EEG data and Machine Learning. My PhD research was conducted at the [Applied Interactive Multimedia (AIM)](https://wp.nyu.edu/aimlab/) and sypervised by [Dr.Mohamad Eid](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/mohamad-eid). I was generously supported by the [Global PhD Student Fellowships in Engineering](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/admissions/graduate/global-phd-student-fellowships-in-engineering.html) during my PhD time.

Prior to NYU, I obtained a master’s degree in Microsystems Engineering from [Masdar Institute of Science and Technology (now Khalifa University)](https://www.ku.ac.ae/). I was fortunate to work there with [Prof. Jerald Yoo](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/jerald-yoo/) to model and characterize printed passive electrical elements on medical Hydrocolloids.
